# My first game in Python (Brazilian version below)

## Note to English readers:  
Before we begin, I'd like to mention that English is not my native language. Please feel free to correct me if you find any mistakes! And the game is currently in Portuguese, but I am working hard on the English translation all by myself. Thanks for your patience! <br>

**Garden of Ashes** is a melancholic psychological horror game about loss and memory. Originally released in Brazilian Portuguese as "*Jardim de Cinzas*", the game follows a boy living a mundane routine: going to school, taking his sister **Isa** to music lessons, and cooking. However, behind this apparent normalcy, a strange creature lurks, waiting to change the course of his life ***forever.***
